        <h1>Pokemon Information</h1>

        <p class="serperior"> Serperior is the fully evolved grass type starter pokemon of the Unova 
        reigon, boasting abase stat total (BST) of 528. While this is on the lower end for starter pokemon, 
        Serperior is still able to hold his own in battle due to his large movepool, high speed stat 
        and access to the combo of leaf storm and the ability contrary. These factors untimately make 
        Serperior nothing to laugh at in terms of power, however he could be outclassed by late-game 
        pokemon. <img src="serperior.png">
        </p>
        <p class="garchomp"> Garchomp is the only Pseudo-legendary pokemon in the Sinnoh reigon, and
        is one of the most powerful pokemon to date. With a massive BST of 600, with 102 speed and 130
        physical attack, Garchomp is one of the most threatening pokemon to battle against. On top of
        these monster stats, it also has a fantastic movepool, allowing for massive sweeps if the 
        opponent is not careful. These all make Garchomp a formidable foe and 100% worth it to put
        on a team. <img src="garchomp.png">
        </p>
        <p class="charizard"> Charizard is one of the most well-known pokemon to ever exist, and
        one of the most recognisable characters in media, and for good reason. With a BST of 534, its
        stats are far from bad. Getting access to a wide range of moves, as well as the amazing hidden
        ability Solar Power allows it to fit really well as a sun-sweeper, making it one of the best
        pokemon for challenge runs or even just normal playthroughs. Charizard is a very powerful
        option if you are in need of a fire type and should not be overlooked. <img class="char" src="charizard.png">
        </p>
        <p class="piakchu"> Pikachu being the mascot of pokemon has been given lots of love by
            Game Freak over the years, however he wasn't nearly as good in the original Pokemon
            Red and Blue. Pikachu has sub-par stats (besides speed, which is a pretty high 90)
            due to being able to evolve, and being a mixed attacker is almost never better than
            sticking to either physical or special. Game Freak have given Pikachu ways to be viable,
            such as the light ball held item which doubles its offensive stats, and giving the partner
            Pikachu in Pokemon: Let's Go Pikachu much better stats than a regular Pikachu. However,
            it is still generally better to evolve your Pikachu or use a different electric type.
