        <p class="serperior"> Serperior is the fully evolved grass type starter pokemon of the Unova 
        reigon, boasting abase stat total (BST) of 528. While this is on the lower end for starter pokemon, 
        Serperior is still able to hold his own in battle due to his large movepool, high speed stat 
        and access to the combo of leaf storm and the ability contrary. These factors untimately make 
        Serperior nothing to laugh at in terms of power, however he could be outclassed by late-game 
        pokemon.

        <p class="garchomp"> Garchomp is the only Pseudo-legendary pokemon in the Sinnoh reigon, and
        is one of the most powerful pokemon to date. With a massive BST of 600, with 102 speed and 130
        physical attack, Garchomp is one of the most threatening pokemon to battle against. On top of
        these monster stats, it also has a fantastic movepool, allowing for massive sweeps if the 
        opponent is not careful. These all make Garchomp a formidable foe and 100% worth it to put
        on a team.
